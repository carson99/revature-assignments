	/*1. RDBMS stands for "Relational Database Management System." A relational database "uses a structure
	 * that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database" 
	 * (Codecademy). It can be/is usually organized into tables. Rows are called "records." A RDBMS is 
	 * "a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database" (Codecademy).
	 *
	 *2. SQL is an open-source universal language that's designed to handle massive amounts of data (Coding Sight).
	 *
	 *3. "Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates 
	 *undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies" (Guru99).
	 *
	 *4. There are seven normal forms—it seems like we might only be dealing with 1NF, 2NF and 3NF.
	 *
	 *5. ACID stands for Atomic, Consistent, Isolation, and Durability. EssentialSQL provides "some informal definitions:
	 * Atomic - Transaction acting on several pieces of information complete only if all pieces successfully save.
	 *   Here, 'all or nothing' applies to the transaction.
	 * Consistent - The saved data cannot violate the integrity of the database. Interrupted modifications are
	 *   rolled back to ensure the database is in a state before the change takes place.
	 * Isolation - No other transactions take place and affect the transaction in question. This prevents 'mid-air collisions.'
	 * Durable - System failures or restarts do not affect committed transactions."
	 *
	 *6. "Isolations levels are used to define the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from 
	 *  resource or data modifications made by other concurrent transactions" (SQL Server Central).
	 *  The levels are Read Uncommitted, Read Uncommitted, Repeatable Read, Serializable, and Snapshot.
	 *7. PostgreSQL—"an open-source SQL database that is not controlled by any corporation" (Codecademy). 
	 *
	 *8. "Integrity constraints are used to apply business rules for the database tables. The constraints
	 * available in SQL are Foreign Key, Not Null, Unique, Check. Constraints can be defined in two ways:
	 *  1. The constraints can be specified immediately after the column definition. This is called 
	 *  column-level definition.
	 *  2. The constraints can be specified after all the columns are defined. This is called 
	 *  table-level definition" (Beginner SQL Tutorial).
